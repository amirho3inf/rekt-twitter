# ðŸ’© Rekt Twitter
Don't ask me about this project. But I'll tell you secretly that this is a project that the university wanted. I was supposed to code a SQL-like parser that can execute some specific SQL queries, get structure of tables from schema.txt (It even should detect the changes in schema file and apply the changes like add, delete, shift a column) and also save data in some text files. It had to have a command prompt. Also I had to use it in another program and use it as the database of a twitter-like project, which is named as Rekt Twitter XD
